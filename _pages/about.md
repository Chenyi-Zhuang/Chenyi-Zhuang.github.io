Currently, I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (2022-2025). \\
I am applying for a PhD in the fall of 2025. If you are interested in me, feel free to contact me by [e-mail](chenyi.zhuang@nuaa.edu.cn).

### Research Interests
I am strongly interested in the potential of generative models for various applications, including text-to-image generation, compositional generation, personalization, style transfer, as well as low-level vision tasks like super-resolution. \\
I am also interested in learning more about how generative models work and why they present the behaviors we observe. In this case, I have also spent a lot of time studying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

### More About Me
My academic career is guided by two principles: "A believing heart is magic" which enables my commitment to any prospective work and project, and "simple but effective" which reflects my high productivity and creativity. \\
Beyond academic life, I love reading ranging from social science to liberal arts, fiction, and more. I also unwind by walking, meditating, and journaling.
