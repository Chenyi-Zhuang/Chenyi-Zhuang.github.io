Currently, I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (2022-2025). I am strongly interested in the potential of generative models for a variety of applications, including text-to-image generation, personalisation, style transfer, compositional understanding/generation, and more. I am also curious about how these generative models function and further explaining their behaviors.

I am applying for 2025-fall PhD program. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me at [Email](chenyi.zhuang@nuaa.edu.cn).
