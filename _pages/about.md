Currently, I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (2022-2025). \\
I am applying for a PhD in the fall of 2025. If you are interested in me, feel free to contact me by [e-mail](chenyi.zhuang@nuaa.edu.cn).

### Research Interests
I am strongly interested in the potential of generative models for various applications, including text-to-image generation, compositional generation, personalization, style transfer, as well as low-level vision tasks like super-resolution. \\
I am also interested in learning more about how generative models work and why they present the behaviors we observe. In this case, I have also spent a lot of time studying vision-language models and large-language models.

### More About Me
I have two principles in my life: "A heart of faith is magic" and "simple but effective". The first is my commitment to any prospective work, the second reflects my work style on productivity and creativity. \\
Beyond academic life, I love reading ranging from social science to liberal arts, fiction, and more. I also unwind by walking, meditating, and journaling.
